Objective: 
The project aimed to analyze telecom user data to identify popular handset brands, study user behavior, and apply machine learning techniques like clustering and regression for meaningful insights.

Data Overview : 
  The dataset included details on handset models, application usage, call duration, and network activity.
  Preprocessing steps involved handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Insights:
  Identified the Top 10 most used handsets and the Top 3 handset manufacturers.
  Analyzed the Top 5 handset models per manufacturer to understand brand popularity.
  Studied user behavior based on app usage, data consumption, and network activity.
  
Machine Learning Models Used:

  K-Means Clustering & PCA:-
    Segmented users into distinct groups based on handset and usage patterns.
    
  Linear Regression:-
    Modeled handset price predictions based on key features.
    
  Silhouette Score:-
    Used to evaluate cluster quality.
    
Key Findings:
  High-end smartphones are preferred by premium users, while mid-range devices are most common.
  User segmentation revealed distinct patterns in mobile usage, enabling targeted marketing strategies.
  Regression analysis provided reasonable price predictions based on handset specifications.
  
Business Recommendations:
