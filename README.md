This project analyzed telecom user data to identify popular handset brands, understand user behavior, and apply machine learning techniques like clustering and regression. The dataset included details on handset models, app usage, and network activity. Through data exploration, we identified the top handset brands and user preferences. K-Means clustering was used to segment users based on their usage patterns, while regression helped predict handset prices. The findings showed that high-end smartphones are preferred by premium users, while mid-range devices are more common. Based on these insights, we recommended targeted marketing strategies, optimized data plans, and brand partnerships. Future work could include analyzing 5G adoption trends and predicting customer churn to further enhance business strategies.
